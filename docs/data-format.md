# Data file format

DevOps Solutions Map uses a data file name by default `solutions.yaml` and expected to be in the `data/` folder.

The file name can be overrided by an environment variable named `DEVOPS_SOLUTIONS_FILE`. However, the presence of the file in `data/` remains mandatory.

This file defines the displayed content. It is split into two main sections.

## devops section

`devops` is the tools list according to their use case and their role in the DevOps delivery chain. The most basic file structure is the following one :

```yaml
devops:
  sides:
    - name: dev
      steps:
        - name: plan
          usecases:
            - name: Use case name
              tools:
                - name: Tool name
                  state: adopt
```

- `sides` is the key related to the two sides of the DevOps : the Dev and Ops columns.
- `steps` is the key for each step in the DevOps workflow : Plan, Code, etc.
- `usescases` is the key for the cards displayed for each column
- `tools` is the key for each tool inside a use case

| Key | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
| ---  | ----- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `devops` | - | Yes | - | The top level of the `devops` section |
| `devops.sides` | - | Yes | - | The top level of the `sides` section |
| ` devops.sides.name` | `string` | Yes | `dev` | The label for the Dev section. This label is automatically capitalized. |
| ` devops.sides.steps` | - | Yes | - | The top level of the `steps` section |
| ` devops.sides.steps.name` | `string` | Yes | `plan` / `code` / `build` / `test` / `release` / `deploy` / `operate` / `monitor` | The label for the steps. This label is automatically capitalized. |
| ` devops.sides.name` | `string` | Yes | `dev` | The label for the Dev section. This label is automatically capitalized. |
| ` devops.sides.steps.usecases` | - | Yes | - | The top level for the usecases section. |
| ` devops.sides.steps.usescases.descr` | `string` | No | `None` | The description of the use-case.<br>[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is supported. |
| ` devops.sides.usecases.name` | `string` | Yes | `None` | The use case name. |
| ` devops.sides.usecases.tools` | - | Yes | - | The top level for the use cases' tools. |
| ` devops.sides.usecases.tools.name` | `string` | Yes | `None` | The tool's name. |
| ` devops.sides.usecases.tools.state` | `string` | Yes | `unknown` | The current state of the tool. Accepted values are : `assess`, `trial`, `adopt`, `hold`.  |
| ` devops.sides.usecases.tools.isnew` | `boolean` | No| `False` | If `True`, the "New" icon will be displayed on the tool's card. |

### State legends

Four different status are available for each tool, and two special one.

| State | Description |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Assess | This tool is evaluated for a potential adoption. Not yet trialed but considered for a futur usage. |
| Trial | This tool is considered as promising but not yet widely adopted, the organization is evaluating its value. |
| Adopt | This tool is the current core model solution for this use-case. |
| Hold | This tools is considered as outdated and no longer relevant. It should not be used anymore. |

Special states

| State | Description |
| ------ | ------------- |
| \<state\> âœ¨ | This tool is a new entry in the radar. |
| \<Grey card\> | This tools is in an unknown status. |

## tools section

The `tools` section is made for describing the Tool : publisher, license, external reference, and custom tags. A relation is made by the application using the tool's name as declared in both the `devops` and `tools` section.

```yaml

tools:
  - name: VSCode
    descr: blah
  - name: Jira
    descr: blah

```

For example, if you declare `GitHub` in the `devops` section, but not in the `tools` section, the tool description will be incomplete. However, the tool's page will remain able to display the tool's usages.

| Key | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
| ---  | ----- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `tools` | - | Yes | - | The top level of the `tools` section |
| `tools.name` | `string` | Yes | `None` | The tool's name, must match the name declared in the use cases. |
| `tools.descr` | `string` | No | `None` | The tool's description.<br>[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is supported. |
| `tools.links` | - | - | - | Top level of the links section |
| `tools.links.name` | `string` | No | `None` | The link name (ex : Official website, CMDB reference, app registry reference...) |
| `tools.links.url` | `string` | No | `None` | The URL for the link. |
| `tools.tags` | - | - | - | Top level of the tags section |
| `tools.tags.name` | `string` | No | `None` | The tag name (ex : License, Owner, etc) |
| `tools.tags.value` | `string` | No | `None` | The tag's value |

You can use YAML's text block for description if required.

Example :

```yaml
tools:
  - name: VSCode
    links:
      - name: Official website
        url: https://code.visualstudio.com
      - name: Application Registry
        url: https://link-to-your-app-registry
    tags:
      - name: License
        value: MIT for Source code, Microsoft proprietary for binaries
